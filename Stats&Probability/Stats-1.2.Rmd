## Basic Theoretical Probability

Flipping a coin has 50% probability of Heads, P(H) = 1/2

```{r}
# dice rolling a 1 on 6 sided die = f/n 
prob = function(f, n){
  p = f/n
  glue('Probability is {round(p, 2)*100}%')
}

prob(2,6) # probability of rolling a 1 or 6
prob(3,6) # probability of rolling an even

```

### Sample space

Find the probability of pulling a yellow marble from a bag with 3 yellow,
2 red, 2 green and 1 blue
```{r}
possible_outcomes = c(
  rep('Y', times=3),
  rep('R', times=2),
  rep('G', times=2),
  rep('B',1)
)

n = length(possible_outcomes)

prob(3, n)
```

Bag of marbles: 9 red, 2 blue, 3 green in it. What is the probability of selecting
a non-blue marble?

```{r}
bag = c( 
  rep('R', times=9, each=1),
  rep('B', times=2, each=1),
  rep('G', times= 3)
)

n = length(bag)
# non blue marble 14-2
prob(12, n)

```

A number is randomly chosen, what is the probability 
that number is a multiple of 5?

```{r}
nums = c(32,49,55,30,56,28,50,40,40,45,3,25)

n = length(nums)

# divide the vector by 5, use modulus to get only the ones with 0
f = sum(nums%%5 == 0)

prob(f,n)
```

Monty Hall Problem

behind 3 doors are prizes, 2 are goats and 1 is cash prize

```{r}
doors = 3

# probability of winning NOT switching door
win_noSwitch = 1/doors
lose_noSwitch = 2/doors

# switch door, probability of picking wrong door is 2/3
win_switch = 2/doors
lose_switch = 1/doors

```


Probability of flipping Heads on 3 coins
```{r}
coin = tribble(
  ~'flip 1',~'flip 2',~'flip 3',
  'T','T','T',
  'T','T','H',
  'T','H','T',
  'T','H','H', #
  'H','T','T',
  'H','T','H', #
  'H','H','T', #
  'H','H','H'
)

n = nrow(coin)

# exactly 2 H
f = 3

prob(f, n)

```




# Sets

x = { }

- `union(x,y)` joins all elements  "OR" `U`
- `intersect(x,y)` elements in both sets  "AND"  
- `setdiff(x,y)` x - y, elements !y but are in x `x\y`
- `setequal(x,y)`
- c %in% y  tests for membership
- `choose(n,k)` k= number of subsets from set size n

```{r}
x = c(6,12,18,24    )
y = c(12,18 )


sort(union(x,y) )
setdiff(x,y) # x\y
intersect(x,y)
```






# Conditional Probability

BAYES THEOREM = P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Probability of event A is 0.6, probability of event B is 0.5, probability
of A given B is 0.7. Find P(B | A).

P(A and B) = P(A | B) * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)

```{r}
A_given_B = 0.7
B = 0.5
A = 0.6

A_and_B = A_given_B * B

glue("P(A and B) = {A_and_B}")

# A * P(B | A) = 0.35
B_given_A = A_and_B / A
glue("P(B given A) = {round(B_given_A,2)}")
```
```{r}
A = 0.55
B = 0.18
AandB = 0.05

BgivenA = AandB/A 
glue("P(B|A) = {round(BgivenA,4)}")

A_given_B = AandB/B
glue("P(A|B) = {round(A_given_B,4)}")
```

1:100, how many are divided by 3 or 2 ?

33 numbers /3 and 50 numbers /2 = 50+33 = 83
drop duplicates like 6 (/3 and /2)
16 numbers are both /2 and /3
83-16 = 67
